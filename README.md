# Analyses of MNIST database of handwritten digits

see **MNIST.pdf** in the repo for the documentation; [or this link for a presentation](http://grfiv.github.io/MNIST/#/). As of June 2015 the project is just getting underway.

The US Post Office’s desire to automate the routing of mail by handwritten zipcode motivated the
creation of the MNIST database of handwritten digits. The database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each 28 × 28 grayscale images of a single digit, and is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, the best of which is reported to have achieved a 0.23% misclassification error rate using convolutional neural networks. Kaggle has a training contest using a variation of the MNIST database. 

This project is my attempt to beat the benchmarks set for the various algorithms described in the 1998 paper by LeCun et al plus a few others of interest to me and my results on Kaggle.
