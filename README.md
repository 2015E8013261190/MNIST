# Analyses of MNIST database of handwritten digits

As of August 2015 I have gotten through all of the algorithms and achieved 0.99257 on the Kaggle Digit Recognition contest using a Theano multi-layer neural network, placing 28th out of 646 entrants.

See [MNIST.pdf](https://github.com/grfiv/MNIST/blob/master/MNIST.pdf) for the detailed documentation. 

The US Post Office’s desire to automate the routing of mail by handwritten zipcode motivated the creation of the MNIST database of handwritten digits. The database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each 28 × 28 grayscale images of a single digit, and is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, the best of which is reported to have achieved a 0.23% misclassification error rate using convolutional neural networks. Kaggle has a training contest using a variation of the MNIST database. 

This project is my attempt to beat the benchmarks set for the various algorithms described in the 1998 paper by [LeCun et al.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) plus some newer algorithms that have become popular, and my results on Kaggle.
